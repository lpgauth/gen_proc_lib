Lightweight Erlang server behaviour

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lpgauth/metal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lpgauth/metal)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/lpgauth/metal/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/lpgauth/metal?branch=master)

## API
### Behaviour callbacks

#### Required

```erlang
-callback handle_msg(Msg :: term(), State :: term()) ->
    {ok, State :: term()}.
```

#### Optional

```erlang
-callback init(Name :: atom(), Parent :: pid(), State :: term()) ->
    {ok, State :: term()}.

-callback terminate(Reason :: term(), State :: term()) ->
    ok.
```
## Example
```erlang
-module(test_server).

-export([
    start_link/1
]).

-behaviour(metal).
-export([
    init/3,
    handle_msg/2,
    terminate/2
]).

start_link(Name) ->
    metal:start_link(?MODULE, Name, undefined).

%% metal callbacks
init(_Name, _Parent, State) ->
    {ok, State}.

handle_msg(_Msg, State) ->
    {ok, State}.

terminate(_Reason, _State) ->
    ok.
```
